The user wants to prepare the existing FleetEase car rental application for an EAS (Expo Application Services) Build to generate an Android APK.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  Create  with a  profile for Android APK builds, using Node 22 and local credentials.
2.  Create  with the provided Android signing configuration.
3.  Fix dependencies by running env: load .env
env: export EXPO_TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN EXPO_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL EXPO_USE_FAST_RESOLVER METRO_CACHE_ROOT
Dependencies are up to date to ensure all are compatible with Expo SDK 54.
4.  Update the UI with modern icons and a splash screen. The company name on the splash screen should have a Typewriter effect.
5.  Update  to use environment variables () for the app name, API URL, and Android package name.
6.  Set the Expo  and  as specified.
7.  After completion, prepare the project to be saved to the user's GitHub repository.

**User's preferred language**: Türkçe

**what currently exists?**
A fully functional MVP of the FleetEase car rental app has been developed.
- **Backend (FastAPI):** A new  was created from scratch, providing endpoints for user authentication (register/login), vehicle listing/details, reservation management (with a mock payment flow), and user notifications. The backend has been tested successfully via  and an automated testing agent.
- **Frontend (Expo/React Native):** A complete mobile application structure using Expo Router. It includes screens for home, vehicle search and details, a multi-step reservation flow, user profile, and authentication (login/register). The UI was visually verified before the current task began.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Preparing the application for an EAS Build. This involved creating build-specific configuration files (, ), updating dependencies, and generating new visual assets (icon, splash screen). The agent's last thought was to update the register and profile screens.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Finalize the EAS Build preparation and UI refresh. (P0)

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1:
     - Attempted fixes: The previous agent successfully created  and , ran  to update dependencies, generated new  and  files, and overwrote , , and .
     - Next debug checklist:
        1.  **Implement Typewriter Effect:** The user requested a Typewriter effect for the company name on the splash screen. This has not been implemented. This will likely require adding a library like  or creating a custom animation.
        2.  **Review UI Changes:** Review the changes made to  and  to ensure they meet the modern UI requirement.
        3.  **Verify Asset Integration:** Check  to confirm that the new  and  are correctly configured.
        4.  **Verify All Configs:** Double-check , , and  against the user's requirements from message #70.
        5.  **Test the UI:** Restart the Expo server and use the  to visually verify the new splash screen, app icon, register screen, and profile screen.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? Completing this will make the application ready for the user to build an Android APK using EAS Build and will fulfill all parts of the user's latest request.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1:  Finalize EAS Build Preparation (P0)

 Task Detail:
  - Task 1:
     - Where to resume: Start by implementing the Typewriter animation on the splash screen. This feature was requested but not yet implemented. Then, proceed with the checklist outlined in Pending/In progress Issue list.
     - What will be achieved with this? The application will be fully configured and visually updated, ready for the user to generate an APK via EAS Build.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? frontend
     - Blocked on something: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    - P1: Implement a real payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, Iyzico) to replace the current mock payment system.
    - P1: Integrate a real push notification service (e.g., Firebase, Expo Push Notifications).
    - P2: Implement the map feature for selecting office locations, which will require an API key from the user.

**Completed work in this session**
- **MVP Development (DONE):**
  - Built a complete FastAPI backend from scratch for the car rental app.
  - Developed a full-featured Expo (React Native) frontend using Expo Router.
  - Implemented core features: auth, vehicle browsing, search, and a mock reservation flow.
- **EAS Prep (Started):**
  - Created  and  for Android builds.
  - Updated dependencies to be compatible with Expo SDK 54.
  - Generated and added new  and  to .
  - Updated  to use environment variables.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - None. All previous issues were resolved during development.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - No previous fork summary was provided.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo (SDK 54), Expo Router, TypeScript, Zustand (for state), React Hook Form
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, MongoDB
- **Build:** Expo Application Services (EAS)

**key DB schema**
While not explicitly defined, the backend code implies the following MongoDB collections:
  - : {user_id, name, email, password_hash, ...}
  - : {vehicle_id, make, model, price_per_day, ...}
  - : {reservation_id, user_id, vehicle_id, start_date, end_date, total_price, status, ...}
  - : {location_id, name, address, ...}
  - : {campaign_id, title, description, ...}
  - : {notification_id, user_id, title, message, read_status, ...}

**changes in tech stack**
  - The project was started from scratch with a new FastAPI backend, deciding against using the initially provided API.

**All files of reference**
- **Created for EAS Build:**
  - : Configures the EAS build process.
  - : Stores Android signing key information.
- **Updated for EAS Build:**
  - : Updated to use environment variables and reference new assets.
  - : Dependencies updated for Expo SDK 54 compatibility.
  - : New application icon.
  - : New splash screen image.
- **Core Application Files:**
  - : The entire backend logic.
  - : The main navigation structure.
  - : Manages user authentication state.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- None at the moment. The code is newly written.

**key api endpoints**

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The main priority is to complete the user's request for EAS Build preparation.
- A key missing piece is the Typewriter animation for the splash screen. This needs to be implemented.
- The user has provided credentials for . The file has been created, but ensure no sensitive data is exposed in logs or outputs.
- After implementing the remaining changes, a thorough visual test of the splash screen, icon, and updated UI screens is necessary before concluding the task.

**documents created in this job**
  - None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**

- **User Message (Msg #70):** Merhaba, bu uygulama EAS Build ile APK oluşturmak için hazır hale getirilmeli... (Hello, this app should be made ready to create an APK with EAS Build...). This is a detailed request outlining all the necessary steps for build preparation, including UI updates. **Status: In Progress.**

**Project Health Check:**
- **Working:** Backend API, core frontend logic, navigation.
- **Mocked:** Payment flow.
- **Broken:** Nothing is explicitly broken, but the UI is undergoing changes that need verification.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- Google Social Login (Planned/Partially implemented via , but full flow not tested).

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: YES (backend testing agent was used and passed).
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: [, ]
  - Known regressions: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- No user credentials needed for the current task. The provided signing credentials have already been placed in .

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent did not implement the Typewriter effect for the company name on the splash screen, which was part of the user's request in message #70.
